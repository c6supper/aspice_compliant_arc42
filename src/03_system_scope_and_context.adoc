== System Scope and Context

// ****
// .Contents
// System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
// (neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

// If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

// .Motivation
// The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

// .Form
// Various options:

// * Context diagrams
// * Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.
// ****
This section describes the environment of {target-project}. Who are its users, and with which other systems does it interact with.

// [role="arc42help"]
// ****
// .Contents
// Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
// Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

// .Motivation
// All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

// .Form
// All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

// Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
// The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

=== Technical Context

// [role="arc42help"]
// ****
// .Contents
// Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

// .Motivation
// Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

// .Form
// E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
// together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
