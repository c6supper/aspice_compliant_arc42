== Introduction and Goals

// [role="arc42help"]
// ****
// Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

// * underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
// * quality goals for the architecture
// * relevant stakeholders and their expectations
// ****

[quote, Global and China Automotive Domain Control Unit (DCU) Industry Report 2021]
____
The EEA upgrade will be the focus in the next 2-3 years, which will accelerate the introduction of domain controllers. The automotive EEA upgrade is mainly reflected in three aspects: software architecture, hardware architecture, and communication architecture. Software architecture will gradually realize hierarchical decoupling, hardware will develop from distributed style to Domain controller/centralized style, and automotive network backbone will develop from LIN/CAN bus to Ethernet.
____
The {target-project} is a foundation software component which mainly focus on the cockpit domain controller's infrastructure layer, working together with {hardware-version} {hardware-name} hardware to deliver a solid platform to automotive OEMs to meet the explosive software demanding driven by the automotive market.

=== Requirements Overview

// [role="arc42help"]
// ****
// .Contents
// Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
// of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
// (with version number and information where to find it).

// .Motivation
// From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
// improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

// .Form
// Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
// If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

// Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.
// ****

.What is {target-project}?
A vehicle cockpit domain controller software platform, which is compatible with {customer}'s {customer-product} architecture.
In addition {hardware-version} {hardware-name} Software Platform could also be ported to other car brands' architectures.

=== Quality Goals

// [role="arc42help"]
// ****
// .Contents
// The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

// .Motivation
// You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
// If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged â€¦

// .Form
// A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
// ****
// referring to https://faq.arc42.org/questions/C-1-2/ and https://arnon.me/2010/05/utility-trees-hatching-quality-attributes/

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
// ****
// .Contents
// Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

// * should know the architecture
// * have to be convinced of the architecture
// * have to work with the architecture or with code
// * need the documentation of the architecture for their work
// * have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

// .Motivation
// You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
// Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
// These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

// .Form
// Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
